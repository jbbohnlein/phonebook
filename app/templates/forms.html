<form method="POST">               <!--all the things we have here inside the double curly braces will play out later when we write our routes-->
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    <div class="form-group">
        <fieldset id="email-field">
            {{ form.email.label }}
            {{ form.email(class = 'form-control', placeholder = 'place email here ') }}
        </fieldset>
    </div>

        <fieldset id="pass-field">
            {{ form.password.label }}
            {{ form.password(class = "form-control", placeholder = "Place password here ") }}
        </fieldset>

        <!-- Submit button area -->
        {{ form.submit_button(class = "btn btn-primary btn-block mt-2")}}

</form>

<!--Note also that on several spots we actually write the bootstrap class data after 
    the form.submit_button or .email locations - this is syntax for allowing Python to take 
    the data back out from the form into our auth routes, while simultaneously styling the form. 
    We'll see soon how these data points connect when we write the auth routes.-->
